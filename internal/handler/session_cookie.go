// setSessionCookie issues the browser session.
//
// SameSite is Lax rather than Strict, and it has to be. Every login ends with
// the upstream IdP redirecting to one of our callbacks, which mints the
// session and immediately redirects on — to /device?user_code=… for the device
// flow. WebKit decides whether that final hop is same-site by looking at the
// whole redirect chain, and the chain was started cross-site by the IdP, so a
// Strict cookie is withheld there. The device page then sees no session and
// bounces back to the IdP, which signs the user in again: the flow could not
// be completed in Safari at all. Chromium updates its site-for-cookies per
// hop and does send a Strict cookie, which is why this only ever broke on one
// engine. See internal/handler/session_cookie_test.go.
//
// Lax costs little here. It only adds the cookie to top-level cross-site GET
// navigations, and no GET endpoint acts on its own: /device merely renders the
// consent screen, and the state-changing POST /device/approve is guarded by
// the same-origin check and the double-submit __Host-device_csrf cookie, which
// stays Strict (see csrf.go).
